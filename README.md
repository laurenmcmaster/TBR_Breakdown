# TBR_Breakdown

# Introduction

I have always had a passion for reading, however, I, like many others, have a hard time finding the time to do so. And with the debut of BookTok, my list of books to read (TBR) is longer than ever. I wanted to see what kind of books I have been getting recommended from TikTok since I have been saving them all to my Goodreads, so I decided to put my new data analysis skills to the test.

# Web Scraping
I scraped my data from my Goodreads TBR, stored it in a data frame, and then exported it to Tableau for visualization.

# Conclusion

The analysis of my TBR has yielded valuable insights into my reading preferences. The diversity of genres, including fiction, contemporary, romance, fantasy, and historical fiction, highlight types of books BookTok recommends and genres I appreciate. The preference for books within the 300-399 page range demonstrates the perfect length of a book in my opinion, with just enough time to tell an incredible story. My top authors included Taylor Jenkins Reid, Sarah J. Maas, Elena Ferrante, Emily Henry, and Leigh Bardugo due to their incredible writing styles and many books to choose from. Ultimately, my diversity analysis showed a variety of different cultures, lifestyles, and social issues in my TBR. Altogether, I found this a fascinating study of my tastes and that of the types of literature being passed around via social media.
