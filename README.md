# TBR_Breakdown

# Introduction

I have always had a passion for reading, however, I, like many others, have a hard time finding the time to do so. And with the debut of BookTok, my list of books to read (TBR) is longer than ever. I wanted to see what kind of books I have been getting recommended from TikTok since I have been saving them all to my Goodreads, so I decided to put my new data analysis skills to the test.

# Web Scraping
I scraped my data from my Goodreads TBR, storing it in a dataframe, and then exporting it to Tableau for visualization.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of my TBR has yielded valuable insights into my reading preferences. The diversity of genres, including fiction, contemporary, romance, fantasy, and historical fiction, showcases the overlap of types of books BookTok recommends and genres I appreciate. Furthermore, the preference for books within the 300-399 page range demonstrates a balanced approach, allowing me to delve into complex narratives without being overwhelmed by length. The prominence of authors like Taylor Jenkins Reid, Sarah J. Maas, Elena Ferrante, Emily Henry, and Leigh Bardugo suggests that their storytelling styles and themes deeply resonate with me. Most significantly, the commitment to diversity in themes and representation, encompassing LGBT, queer, lesbian, and feminism, along with books depicting a myriad of cultures, underscores a conscious effort to engage with literature that addresses an array of social and cultural issues. Altogether, I found this a fascinating study of my tastes and that of the types of literature being passed around via social media.
